<h2>Design Thinking</h2>

I created this snow deformation shader for use in my game. I required a dynamic snow system to ground the player (a red fox) in the world.
There had to be spaces that felt as if the snow was weighing the character down and other areas where it would just add a little more depth and detail to the environment. The main feature I wanted to achieve was persistence and the ability to take that persistence away.<br/> 
Leaving behind permanent paw prints gives the player agency in the world.  However, snow can often be used to represent a covering up of events, removing evidence that something was there before, emulating despair or the feeling of a fresh start. <br/>
From a gameplay perspective, the player may use the trails left like a guide. But weather may take effect, disorienting the player with a fresh coat of snow, adding to the sense of loss I want my game to exhibit. This meant that the snow deformation had to be dynamic. <br/>
Once the basic system was in place I started to add environment assets, most frequently used were trees. I wanted every single tree to have snow build up based on wind direction. This would be a chore by hand so I made the tech work in my favour by dynamically building up the snow based on a few parameters thatâ€™ll run at construction (or can be pre-baked).<br/>
Artistically I wanted the snow to be cold and Icey, to achieve this I used multiple different snow textures, height maps, normal maps and finally two overlapping glitter maps to get that sparkly look. The snow needed to feel cold and distant and exaggeratedly deep, in terms of a fox.
